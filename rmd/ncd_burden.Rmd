# Non-Communicable Disease Burden (NCD)

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the non-communicable diseases data
data_ncd <- read_csv(here("data", "burden-of-disease-ncd.csv"))
```

## Table of Estimates for NCD Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries 
# You should pivot the data to show each country in a separate column.
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
```

## Plot Showing Trends in NCD Burden Over Time 

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
```
